# WriterCLI
A CLI for writing and managing a personal Wiki of knowledge.

What is this for?
The main problem with maintaining a personal Wiki (in my experience) is managing links between pages. With Zim, it's relatively easy to link pages together manually; it has no automatic feature for this, and as it was my last hope for a tool that serves me and my writing style, it seems I have to make my own.

WriterCLI allows:
* "dangling links" to be automatically filled when the linked-to document is made
* Simple HTML links to be created between "blog posts" of known format

Requirements:
* Zim (http://zim-wiki.org/)


This is planned to later form the foundation of a blogging experience, wheri you are able to share your personal wiki with the world!
